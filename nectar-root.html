	<h1> Nectar & Root </h1>

	<p> Nectar & Root was a rebranding project I did for a wedding and floral company in Vermont. A big focus on their services is their personalized floral arrangements, and I wanted to call a lot of attention to that fact. </p>

	<p> Made using: Illustrator, Photoshop </p>

	<h3> Brand Items </h3>

	<p> An idea I thought would help to show their personalization and thought that went into each floral arrangement would be a tag attached to each bouquet that served as both a memento and info card. On each card would be a list of the flowers chosen in the bouquet as well as their meaning and what made them suitable for that occasion or that couple. </p>

	<p> I also wanted to create the business cards for the company to use; something that was delicate, but purposeful. I imagined a gentle typeface (Iskra) onset to a textured material card, representing the Earthy nature of the brand. </p>

	<p> The brochure was my main presenting piece, something for Nectar & Root to hand out and place on display at their point of business. The brochure would detail their basic business information: what they did and who they catered towards. I went with a dark purple to establish a sense of both maturity and elegance. </p>
