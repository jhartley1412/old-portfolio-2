	<h1> Nectar & Root </h1>

	<p> Nectar & Root was a rebranding project I did for a wedding and floral company in Vermont. A big focus on their services is their personalized floral arrangements, and I wanted to call a lot of attention to that fact. </p>

	<p> Made using: Illustrator, Photoshop </p>

	<h3> Brand items </h3>

	<p> I wanted this app to be easy to easily digestible; the target audience was children, after all. I know I wanted a badge system, some way for users to have physical proof of accomplishment, and I wanted lessons to only appear when they were playable. As users completed lessons, they'd unlock new ones where they'd be able to show off more and more badges to family and friends. </p>

	<h3> Style Tiles </h3>

	<p> Even after doing research I wasn't sure if I wanted to focus on education or fun when designing the visual elements of this app. I went through a few different style tiles, choosing different themes and seeing what worked and what didn't. After conversing with my peers I decided to put emphasis on fun and adventure, ultimately landing with a golden yellow for my primary color and a system where each subject had its own corresponding color (Blue for history, green for math, etc). </p>
