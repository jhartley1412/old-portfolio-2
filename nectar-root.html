    	<h2> Nectar & Root </h2>

    	<p> Nectar & Root is a floral and bridal company in Vermont. I did a project with them a while back to practice my branding design and create a new brand for them. I created a new logo, a sample design of a brochure and business card designs.  </p>

    	<p> Since Nectar & Root deals in flower arrangements, flowers had to be the start of the show. I was able to find high-quality photographs of flower bouquets, wedding photos and the like provided by them. Keeping in line with putting the spotlight on the flowers I created a brochure that both showcased their talent and beautiful designs but was balanced well with information about their company and what they did for their customers.  </p>

    	<p> To accompany the elegance portrayed in the brochure I wanted the business cards to be just as delicate. I designed the business cards to be simple, to-the-point and dainty yet professional. I liked the idea of using a grainy material for the business cards to portray the earthiness of the outdoors and of flowers themselves.  </p>

    	<p> I came up with the idea of bouquet table tags. When bouquets were placed on tables during an event, each one would come with a tag that labeled what flowers were involved in the bouquet as well as either historical or symbolic meaning attached to them. This brings a sense of entertainment (and education) to each bouquet and gives the viewer a higher sense of attachment as well.   </p>
