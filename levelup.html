    	<h2> LevelUpLearning </h2>

    	<p> LevelUpLearning was a project I did for The Iron Yard; The goal was to create an application or a website that solves a problem. I’ve always been interested in the use of technology in education, so I focused to make a solution for students in elementary to middle school who are struggling with school and give them an alternative method of teaching; learn through interaction instead of lecture. </p>

			<p> Since I was designing for kids, I needed to make sure that the app’s design was clean and straightforward. I went through multiple iterations to find a structure that was easy to understand as well as responsive. In my mind the final product would be largely used on a tablet, but with the capability of students being able to work at home on their (or their parent’s) computer. </p>

			<p> Like most projects, it was hard not to jump right into the design process immediately. I had a rough concept in mind when I thought up this project, but needed to do more research to justify my reasoning. I looked through apps and websites that already existed out there to get a sense of what looked good and what didn’t; the imagery they used, the different methods of teaching, I even looked at common school curriculums and what subjects students had the hardest time grappling with. </p>

			<p> After researching came wireframing. I knew I wanted to focus on gamification to keep a child's attention. Positive reinforcement was key to making a child feel accomplished, and it was important that the student would be challenged but engaged. Thus I added the badge system; a student completes a lesson and earns a badge. </p>

			<p> I needed a brand that was inviting yet educationally stimulating. I had originally come up with three different directions to take; energetic and fun, studious, or childlike and playful. I ended up mixing the three, focusing on friendliness and being inviting. </p>
