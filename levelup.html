    	<h2> LevelUpLearning </h2>

    	<p> LevelUpLearning was a personal project I did for The Iron Yard; The goal was to create an application or a website that solves a problem. I’ve always been interested in the use of technology in education, so I focused to make a solution for students in elementary to middle school who are struggling with school and give them an alternative method of teaching; learn through interaction instead of lecture. </p>

    	<p>You can view the app <a href="../images/levelup/levelup-banner.jpg" target="_blank"> Live </a> or on <a href="https://github.com/jhartley1412/Level-Up-Learning-App" target="_blank"> GitHub </a>
		</p>

		<p> Made using: Illustrator, Photoshop, HTML, CSS and Sass, jQuery, Jekyll </p>

    	<p> Since my main target was kids, I needed to make sure that the app’s design was clean and straightforward. I went through multiple iterations to find a structure that was easy to understand as well as responsive. In my mind the final product would be largely used on a tablet, but with the capability of students being able to work at home on their (or their parent’s) computer. </p>

		<p> Like most of my projects, it was hard for me not to jump right into the design process immediately. I had a rough concept in mind when I thought up this project, but needed to do more research to justify my reasoning. I looked through apps and websites that already existed out there to get a sense of what looked good and what didn’t; the imagery they used, the different methods of teaching, I even looked at common school curriculums and what subjects students had the hardest time grappling with. </p>

		<p> After researching came wireframing. One thing I knew I wanted to focus on was gamification and keeping a child's attention for a longer period of time. Positive reinforcement was key to making a child feel accomplished, and it was important that the student would be challenged but engaged. A common method of this was to use badges that the student would earn whenever they finished a lesson was a given in that sense. </p>

		<p> I’m not a professional programmer, so my lessons on the final product just state facts and aren't truly interactive lessons, but the idea is there. The student would start a lesson and learn by going through different adventures, going at their own pace. Once a lesson is completed, they’d earn a badge that would show their accomplishment, what subject it was for, when they earned it, and what level of difficulty it fell under. Student’s would unlock new lessons whenever they earned enough badges on that subject. </p>

		<p> As I was working through the mechanics, I was simultaneously working on how LevelUpLearning would look visually. I needed a brand that was inviting yet educationally stimulating. I had originally come up with three different directions to take; energetic and fun, studious, or childlike and playful. I ended up mixing the three, focusing on friendliness and being inviting. </p>
