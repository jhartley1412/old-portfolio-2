    	<h2> LevelUpLearning </h2>

    	<p> LevelUpLearning was a personal project I did for The Iron Yard. The goal was to create an application or a website that solves a problem. I've always been interested in education and the idea of introducing technology into the classroom, so I focused on creating an app that could be used by struggling or disinterested children to learn via an alternative method; learn through interaction instead of lecture. </p>

    	<p>You can view the app <a href="../images/levelup/levelup-banner.jpg" target="_blank"> Live </a> or on <a href="https://github.com/jhartley1412/Level-Up-Learning-App" target="_blank"> GitHub </a>
		</p>

		<p> Made using: Illustrator, Photoshop, HTML, CSS and Sass, jQuery, Jekyll </p>

    	<p> One thing I knew I wanted to focus on early on was gamification and keeping a child's attention. From a lot of research, I knew that positive reinforcement was key to making a child feel accomplished, and it was important that the student (the user) was being both challenged but engaged. The idea to include badges that the student would collect whenever they finished a lesson was a given in that sense.</p>

		<p> Unfortunately, through both time constraints as well as a lack of professional knowledge on early education, I could only include "placeholder" lessons that would give a viewer an idea of how a student who was struggling in school might be captivated through a lesson that was completely interactive. I've read a lot of articles that advocate towards experience being one of the best ways to retain information (i.e. remembering hard facts via having first-hand experiences that trigger that knowledge). </p>

		<p> When it came to aesthetics, obviously being targeted towards younger kids I needed a brand that was inviting yet stimulating. I had originally come up with three different directions to take; energetically fun, overly studious, or extremely childish. I ended up mixing the three, focusing mostly on friendliness and invitingness. </p>

		<p> Yellow-gold was seen as a double-win in being both friendly and mentally stimulating. Paired with light blues and greens and pinks for the lessons themselves allowed the lessons to stand out and be identifiable by their colors, again reaching for that association aspect. In the end, I believe that it came together really nicely, and I hope to continue this idea in the future. </p>
