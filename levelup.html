	<p> LevelUpLearning is a solution to a problem. The problem is that some students (specifically elementary students in this case) just don't learn effectively in the traditional lecture style of teaching that most public schools offer. My solution is this: create an app that will coexist alongside lectures as a tool for teaching struggling students the same material through interaction and visual stimuli. </p>

	<p> This project required a lot of research on my part, from looking up how curriculums are organized to seeing what subjects students in elementary school struggle the most with to the longevity and credibility of technology in the classroom (some of which I have researched in the past, specifically how useful games can be in education). My research led me to design an app that wouldn't be used instead of the typical classroom agenda, but alongside it, to further instill the teachings, as well as engage a student's interest to conduct further studies into subjects they found interesting. </p>
