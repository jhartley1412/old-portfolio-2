	<h1> Rec Sports </h1>
		
	<img src="./images/recsports/paper-proto.jpg" class="project_banner">

	<p> Rec Sports was an idea of mine for a recreational sports app; I chose to focus on swimming, but the app would be able to tailor towards any sports team. </p>

	<p> When researching how to set this up I looked at other sports-related apps that were currently on the market; apps like Moxie, TeamSnap, and MeetMobile. I wanted to come up with a design that was both functional as a place to set up team meetings and schedule upcoming events but was also a handy tool for keeping your team organized. Thus the mockups are catered around the team leader's login. </p>

	<p>You can view the app <a href="https://invis.io/8270GPRE7#/151363298_Upcoming_Meets_Page" target="_blank"> Live </a> or on <a href="https://github.com/jhartley1412/Swimming_RecTeamApp" target="_blank"> GitHub </a>

	<h3> User Flows </h3>

	</div>

	<p> The organization of actions came per paper prototyping and watching where my peers reached for instinctively and what their eyes searched the page for. </p>

	<h3> Style Tiles </h3>

	</div>

	<p> When it came to aesthetics I wasn't sure if I wanted to cater towards parents and adults who've joined a sports team as a recreational escape from their daily responsibilities, or for the young adults who use recreational sports more seriously. After talking with my peers at The Iron Yard, I chose the former.  </p>
