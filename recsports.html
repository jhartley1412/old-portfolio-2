	<h1> Rec Sports </h1>

	<p> Rec Sports was an idea of mine for a recreational sports app; I chose to focus on swimming, but the app would be able to tailor towards any sports team. </p>

	<p> When researching how to set this up I looked at other sports-related apps that were currently on the market; apps like Moxie, TeamSnap, and MeetMobile. I wanted to come up with a design that was both functional as a place to set up team meetings and schedule upcoming events but was also a handy tool for keeping your team organized. Thus the mockups are catered around the team leader's login. </p>

	<p>You can view the app <a href="https://invis.io/8270GPRE7#/151363298_Upcoming_Meets_Page" target="_blank"> Live </a> or on <a href="https://github.com/jhartley1412/Swimming_RecTeamApp" target="_blank"> GitHub </a>

	<h3> Mockups </h3>

	</div>

	<p> I wanted this app to be easy to easily digestible; the target audience was children, after all. I know I wanted a badge system, some way for users to have physical proof of accomplishment, and I wanted lessons to only appear when they were playable. As users completed lessons, they'd unlock new ones where they'd be able to show off more and more badges to family and friends. </p>

	<h3> Style Tiles </h3>

	</div>

	<p> Even after doing research I wasn't sure if I wanted to focus on education or fun when designing the visual elements of this app. I went through a few different style tiles, choosing different themes and seeing what worked and what didn't. After conversing with my peers I decided to put emphasis on fun and adventure, ultimately landing with a golden yellow for my primary color and a system where each subject had its own corresponding color (Blue for history, green for math, etc). </p>
