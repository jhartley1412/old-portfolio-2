    	<h2> Cities Across America </h2>

    	<p> Cities Across America is a pet project of mine that I've had in mind since college. I've traveled a lot in my life and have grown an interest in different methods and stylings of architecture and how a cities culture can influence their buildings and layouts (and vise versa). I thought up the idea for a coffee table book that would include scenery and city skylines from different cities all across America with historical information and tidbits about that city.  </p>

    	<p> The layout came easily to me. This would be a book about cities and their skylines, so big grandiose photographs of cities was a must. I thought up having each chapter of the book cover a different city and for each chapter page to be made up of an image of that city's skyline. I wanted to add a spice of culture of that city as well and came up with the idea of adding a quote referencing the city in some way on the top left. Small enough as to not take away from the image but still present.  </p>

    	<p> The interior of the chapters themselves, the history, was a little more difficult. I didn't want just columns of text that would bore the reader. I played around with manipulating the text in a way that was fun and custom to that city. Maybe I'd reference a famous building or statue by having the text be in the same shape. </p>

    	<p> Although not a real book (yet) my biggest flaw with this project is the lack of photographs. I'm no photographer and don't have the means to travel all across the country taking pictures of skylines. One day I'd like to pursue this idea further. </p>
